# Architecture model toolkit

This is a template repo for architecture modelling with a heavy focus on the very basic set-up, decisions, and the tooling to support it.

Current tooling is heavily based on [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) and is basically a compilation of different tools.

Here's the description of the setup:

[Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/) is the tool of choice for interacting with workspace. Shell scripts in the `bin` directory facilitate and unify interactions.

[Structurizr Lite](https://structurizr.com/help/lite) for previewing, editing and interacting with workspace through browser. It's by far the most complex tool for the C4 model, and we're including it by default. Run `./bin/lite` to start it.

[Structurizr CLI](https://github.com/structurizr/cli) for exporting, publishing, workspace validation, and some other automation. Sometimes it's just more handy than running `Lite`. Run `./bin/cli` to interact with CLI. Alternatively, run `./bin/validate` to validate the workspace, or `./bin/export` to export the workspace.

[structurizr-ruby](https://github.com/Morozzzko/structurizr-ruby) for JRuby [scripting](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl/blob/master/docs/language-reference.md#scripts) and interactive REPL for querying workspace. Run `./bin/repl` to open a REPL session

GitHub Actions for automated deploys.

GitHub Codespaces for editing on the go.

## Installation

1. Install [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for VS Code
2. Open the repository in VS Code and click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
3. That's it!

## Running Structurizr Lite

The template incorporates the latest version of Structurizr Lite. Run `./bin/lite` to launch it in the current workspace

## Running Structurizr CLI

In case you need Structurizr CLI for validations, export, pushing, or anything else, there are sample commands to run it. Here are the basic ones:

* `./bin/cli` – run Structurizr CLI
* `./bin/validate` – shortcut to validate the workspace
* `./bin/export` – shortcut to export the workspace to the output directory
* `./bin/push` – to push the workspace to Structurizr Cloud or On-Premise instance
* `./bin/stop` – stop the running devcontainer

## GitHub actions

The template comes with a GitHub action to push the workspace to Structurizr instance, either cloud or on-premise. By default, it launches on `workflow_dispatch`, meaning you need to run it automatically from `Actions` tab of your repo. 

However, if you'd like to run it automatically on each push to `main`, feel free to edit `.github/workflows/deploy_workspace.yml` and uncomment the following lines:

```yaml
  # push:
  #   branches:
  #     - main
```

That'll make it work for each push to the repo.

If you'd like to use GitHub actions, you'll need to configure environment first. See next section.

## Pushing workspace to Structurizr instance

If you have a Structurizr workspace on either structurizr.com or an on-premise installation, you'd probably want to upload your local workpace every now and then.

There are basically three ways to do so:

* `./bin/push` through structurizr CLI
* GitHub Actions
* GitHub Codespaces: use `structurizr.sh push`

All of those options require their own credentials. For the sake of uniformity, all the tooling assumes _the same variable names_ everywhere

* `STRUCTURIZR_WORKSPACE_ID` — workspace ID, what you'd put under `-id ...` in CLI
* `STRUCTURIZR_WORKSPACE_KEY` — workspace key, `-key ...`
* `STRUCTURIZR_WORKSPACE_SECRET` — workspace secret, `-secret ...`
* `STRUCTURIZR_URL` — structurizr instance URL, `-url https:/..`

If you'd like to have any of those features enabled, you need to supply ENV accordingly. The DevContainer is configured to automatically inherit these environment variables from your host system. You can also use `.devcontainer/devcontainer.env` file to supply those.
    
If you'd like to use `./bin/push`, make sure these environment variables are set before starting the DevContainer.

## Conventions

The main expectation is that you'd use this repo as a template for your workspaces and models. Feel free to fork and modify this repo to fit your own needs.

Right now the most sigificant parts of the model look like this:

```
.
├── docs
│   └── 01-test.md
│   ├── .keep
├── output
│   ├── .keep
├── workspace.dsl
└── workspace.json
```

Basically, what we've got are:

1. Workspace files -- both DSL and JSON files. DSL is supposed to be authored by us, while JSON is supposed to be generated by CLI or Structurizr Lite.
2. `docs` directory for documentation. It contains an example of embedding diagrams.
2. `output` directory for all of the CLI-generated outputs. It's gitignored, so feel free to put anything there
